My attempt at replicating Bionic Reading style word bolding in Python.

---
#### Usage:  
`py main.py "Your Text Here" [optional: markdown, default: html]`  
Defaults to HTML-style bolding (\<b>text\</b>), but has support for Markdown-style (\*\*text\*\*) by putting "markdown" for the 2nd argument.
